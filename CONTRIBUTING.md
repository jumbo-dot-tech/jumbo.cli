### Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome. Before submitting:

> I grant the project maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and sublicense my contributions, including for commercial purposes, while the open source project remains available under the AGPL-3.0 license.
