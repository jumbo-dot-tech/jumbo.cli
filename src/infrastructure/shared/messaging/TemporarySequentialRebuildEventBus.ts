/**
 * TEMPORARY WORKAROUND - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
 *
 * This event bus addresses a race condition during database rebuild where
 * cross-aggregate projection handlers (e.g., SessionSummaryProjectionHandler)
 * attempt to read from projections (e.g., goal_views) while primary handlers
 * are still writing to them.
 *
 * The root cause: InProcessEventBus executes handlers in parallel via Promise.all(),
 * which works fine during normal operations but causes issues during rebuild when
 * projections don't exist yet.
 *
 * This workaround forces sequential handler execution during rebuild only.
 * It does NOT fix the architectural issue that cross-aggregate projections
 * read from other projections instead of having events contain necessary data.
 *
 * REMOVAL PLAN:
 * This will be removed when Epic/Feature/Task redesign is complete, which will
 * address session continuity, goal continuity post-compaction, and portability
 * with a more robust event-driven architecture.
 *
 * @see LocalDatabaseRebuildService - Uses this during rebuild
 * @see InProcessEventBus - Normal parallel execution for regular operations
