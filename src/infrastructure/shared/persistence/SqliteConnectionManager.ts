/**
 * SqliteConnectionManager - Database Connection Management
 *
 * Implements IDbConnectionManager port interface using better-sqlite3.
 *
 * Design Pattern: RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
 * - Resource (DB connection) acquired in constructor
 * - Resource released in dispose()
 * - Ensures deterministic cleanup
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 * 1. Created once at application startup in bootstrap()
 * 2. Injected into projection stores that need database access
 * 3. Disposed once at application exit in CLI entry point
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Infrastructure Layer: Defines IDbConnectionManager interface and SqliteConnectionManager implementation
 * - Presentation Layer: Never touches this directly (uses container)
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // In bootstrap (composition root)
 * const dbConnectionManager = new SqliteConnectionManager(`${jumboRoot}/jumbo.db`);
 * const sessionStore = new SqliteSessionProjectionStore(dbConnectionManager);
 * return { dbConnectionManager, sessionStore, ... };
 *
 * // In CLI entry point
 * const container = bootstrap(jumboRoot);
 * try {
 *   await program.parseAsync();
 * } finally {
 *   await container.dbConnectionManager.dispose(); // Cleanup once
 * }
 *
 * // In projection store
 * class SqliteSessionProjectionStore {
 *   constructor(private dbManager: IDbConnectionManager) {}
 *
 *   async save(projection: SessionProjection): Promise<void> {
 *     const db = this.dbManager.getConnection();
 *     // Use connection...
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
